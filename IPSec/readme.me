This guide will walk through the set up of an IKEv2 VPN using OpenIKED on OpenBSD. It will detail a “road warrior” 
configuration, and use a PSK (pre-shared-key) for authentication. I’m sure it can be easily adapted to work on any other 
platforms that OpenIKED is available on, but keep in mind my steps are specifically for OpenBSD.
